  <h1>Punters top ten tips to the Dolomites</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>My recent trip to Dolomites was a massive learning curve as I have been climbing for over 5 years but only on Sport or bouldering trips.
<br />The vibe was very different to a sport trip where you are just rocking up with a rope + draws and just trying to bone down on some tiny crimps or shake out on a tufa fest.<br /> Everything feels a bit more serious, the fear of getting caught up on a tower in a lightening storm.. the falling rocks.. the climbing becomes a small part as you need to be able to focus on reading the route, placing gear and moving quick (The aim is 20 minutes a pitch including building a belay and bringing up the second).</p>

<p>Here are my top ten tips:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Go Trad climbing especially multipitching to practice your belays, the belay&#39;s in the Dolomites will/should be equipped but sometimes need backing up. Also I found we were loads quicker at building a belay because we had built so many pure gear/natural ones.</p>

<br />
One of my first belays after a stint of sport climbing.</p></li>
<li><p>Have a go at just using a large sling to build your belays, this means your rope is not in the system making it easy for a leader to do two pitches back to back. This saves time on switching over gear and means you both stay a bit warmer.
<br />
Petzl have a nice article <a href="https://www.petzl.com/GB/en/Sport/Installing-an-equalized-belay-station?ActivityName=Multi-pitch-climbing#.WAz1pJMrKRs" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Prepare for scree warfare, people told me about the chossy rock on the wall but no one mentioned that a lot of the approaches involved long walks up scree paths then if you are unlucky you will have a long scree walk out. Basically pack decent appoach shoes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/scree_warfare.jpg" alt="Picture scree walk ins"></p></li>
<li><p>Prusiks, not one but 2+ or at least know how to tie a <a href="https://ropeguerrilla.org/2014/01/18/klemheist/" target="_blank">Klemheist</a>. I may have abseiled off a tower which should have only been 50 metres but it ended up being more like 70 metres with only one Prusik, no knot in the end of the rope.
<br />
This was super stupido and luckily someone passed me a couple of Prusiks otherwise I would have needed to call mountain rescue. Also remember guidebooks make mistakes.</p></li>
<li><p>Carrying on from my last point the reason I made that mistake was I was freezing cold cause I hadn’t worn enough warm clothes. Pack warm clothes and don&#39;t rush decents.</p></li>
<li><p>leave your short draws at home. Most pitches are broken so you will end up extending most placements.</p></li>
<li><p>the queues are real and great to watch.</p>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/dolomites_queues.jpg" alt="Picture of the crazy queues on climbs in the dolomites"></p></li>
<li><p>This is more of a general trad tip if you try and place marginal gear three things will likely happen:</p>

<ol>
<li>You will get pumped.</li>
<li>Your brain will start telling you that if you fall now that won&#39;t hold.</li>
<li>It will most likely come out and you will hear it rattling down the rope.. at this point point 2 will really kick in.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>We started out carrying loads of gear and quickly learnt that most pitches are protected on the cruxes with pegs/instu gear. Because of this we would only ever use a couple of pieces when going over easier ground. Mostly this meant we would only carry the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 mid sized cams, we went for the ones with the biggest caming range.</li>
<li>6 mid nuts, just the odd ones.</li>
<li>Roughly 12 long quickdraws, the Comici requires 16!</li>
<li>The rock is full of threads so loads of slings (at least 3),</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/dolomites_mini_rack.jpg" alt="Picture of our minified rack"></p>

<p>(Please don&#39;t follow this tip blindly, this worked for us but you could get on a very different route)</p></li>
<li><p>Always wear sun cream</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is what I learnt from 10 days in the Dolomites but remember these tips were written by a punter who nearly abbed off a rope so please seek professional advice before acting any of them out.</p>
