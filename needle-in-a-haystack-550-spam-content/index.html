  <h1>Missing Emails == Needle in a Haystack</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>I recently joined the Happiness squad at LostMyName and after a few days I was alerted by our customer service staff that some of our customers were not receiving emails.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>At first I thought it was just a case of emails going into junk because Mandrill was indicating that the email had been delivered but it quickly became apparent that email were not making it to customers.</p>

<caption>Mandrill indicating that the email was delivered successfully</caption></p>

<p>My next step was to contact Mandrill to see if they had any suggestions, their response was that after they get a successful response from the email service provider there job is done.
Mandrill support suggested contacting the service provider, I wanted to try and avoid this as I knew from experience this would be a nightmare but at this point I had no other ideas so I emailed the spam email account.</p>

<p>Almost immediately I got a reply from the mail server saying the mailbox was full and could not store the email. Told you so.</p>

<p>At this point I was completely out of ideas. A colleague suggested that it could be the IP addresses used by Mandrill, I had considered this but had rejected because there were only a few hundred missing emails.</p>

<h2>The Cause</h2>

<p>I emailed Mandrill enquiring about the IP addresses and at this point they said that the IP&#39;s were fine, the issue was the status code being sent back by the email provider:</p>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/550-spam-detected.png" alt="550 Spam Detected">
<caption>Cheers Mandrill...</caption></p>

<p>Mandrill admitted that the response wasn&#39;t getting parsed correctly and because of this emails were incorrectly being shown as delivered.
Now I knew the issue the actual debugging started, I looked at the email template and decided it was ether the images or the buttons (links inside tables).</p>

<p>To test this I needed access to an email account on the domain which was hard because it was a French ISP who only gave out accounts to customers. I lucked out and one of the customer services staff dad had an email account and the patience to handle me hounding him.</p>

<p>After trialling removing different elements I found it was the button. The next experiment was to see if sending test emails with a unstyled link and it worked!</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>The problem made perfect sense in hindsight if you read the Mailchimp guide (in references), this button breaks two rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid bright red fonts or going crazy with colors.</li>
<li>DON’T YELL IN ALL CAPS.</li>
</ul>

<p>After changing the colour and removing the CAPS it worked perfectly!</p>

<p>Hope this helps someone.</p>
